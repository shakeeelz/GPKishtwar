Currently operating from a rented facility, the construction of our state-of-the-art campus is well underway and progressing at full pace. Once completed, the new campus will offer modern classrooms, laboratories, and other facilities, providing an enriched learning experience. The institute is committed to producing well-rounded technocrats equipped with both practical skills and theoretical knowledge, contributing to the socio-economic development of the region and beyond.</p>
